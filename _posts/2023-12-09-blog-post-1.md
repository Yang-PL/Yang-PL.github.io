#### Radio Tomographic Imaging with Wireless Networks
This paper presents a linear model for using received signal strength (RSS) measurements to obtain images of moving objects.

This paper explores in detail the use of shadowing losses on links between many pairs of nodes in a wireless network to image the attenuation of objects within the network area.
